      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>
        This website is set in Newsreader, commissioned exclusively for Google Fonts by Production Type. Reminiscent of
        old-style typefaces like Bembo, while maintaining the tightness, tall x-height, and geometry of more
        contemporary typefaces like Georgia, and infused with clever tech Newsreader is designed for
        continuously-flowing paragraphs on all text and all screens—much like the one you’re using now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Select headings are set in <a href="https://fraunces.undercase.xyz/"><i>Fraunces</i> by Undercase Type</a>, on
        commission for Google Fonts. As its name suggests,
        <i>Fraunces</i> is a love letter to New York City’s history, a celebration of its diversity and contradictions,
        of
        tradition and ingenuity. Managing somehow to borrow from a dizzying array of influences, its upright variant
        reminds me of <i>Cheltenham</i>, <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Souvenir</i> , while its italic variants serve up
        <i>Didot</i> and <i>Bookman</i>
        All this, while infused with modern font tech such as dynamic optical sizing and variable font axes. Here you
        see this typeface at maximum softness and wonkiness. It is perhaps the only font with softness built in.

      <h2>Coded by hand</h2>
      <p>
        This website is coded by hand (with the exception of code indentation, handled by whatever code editor I happen
        to be using at the moment.) I don’t minify my source code. It is written with the aim of concision, not
        obfuscation or maximal space efficiency. Without trackers or JavaScript, it’s more carbon-friendly than 98% of
        websites.
