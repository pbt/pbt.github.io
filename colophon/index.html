    <p>
      Here I describe how I made this website.
    </p>

    <section id="typography">
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>Text is set in <a href="https://mass-driver.com/article/md-lorien-a-parallel-to-caslon"><i>MD Lórien</i> by
          Mass-Driver Type</a>. Structured by the work of William Caslon and Johann Michael Fleischmann, among others
        who were themselves influenced by 1700s Dutch typography, <i>Lórien’s</i> letterforms are buttressed in
        typographical history, while its distinct and sometimes surprising stylistic flair add freshness. It is what one
        might call a “transitional” typeface, straddling the old and the new. But I love something that feels at once
        familiar and fresh—like a well-tailored and well-worn tweed jacket. And like a well-tailored outfit, it looks
        great without ever looking ostentatious or precious. Finally, it is impeccably and precisely kerned, clearly
        with a dedicated human touch. This font is served by <a href="https://fontstand.com/">Fontstand</a>, a
        cooperative of independent type designers. </p>
      <p>Select headings are set in <a href="https://fraunces.undercase.xyz/"><i>Fraunces</i> by Undercase Type</a>, on
        commission for Google Fonts. As its name suggests, <i>Fraunces</i> is a love letter to New York City’s history,
        a celebration of its diversity and contradictions, of tradition and ingenuity, of its downright goofiness.
        Managing somehow to borrow from a dizzying array of influences, its upright variant reminds me of
        <i>Cheltenham</i>, <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Souvenir</i> , while its italic variants serve up <i>Didot</i> and
        <i>Bookman</i> All this, while infused with modern font tech such as dynamic optical sizing and variable font
        axes. Here you see this typeface at maximum softness and wonkiness. It is perhaps the only font I have
        encountered with softness built in.

      <h2>Code &amp; Writing</h2>
      <p>
        This website is coded by hand, paired with the excellent <a href="https://helix-editor.com">Helix</a> code
        editor. I don’t minify my source code. It is written with the aim of concision, not
        obfuscation or maximal space efficiency. As it's not reliant on trackers or JavaScript, it can be viewed
        efficiently by any device.
      </p>
      <p>
        I type my writing directly into the editor as HTML. I don't even use spell-check.</p>
