    <h1>Letting go of frameworks, and how that feels</h1>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>frameworks feel like a box that's too small for me</li>
      <li>i want to understand the limits of my tooling and understanding</li>
      <li>no one would pay me to do this</li>
      <li>it sounds weirdly... fun?</li>
    </ol>

      <h2>A parable</h2>
      <p>ever since i moved to my current place, there's been this pile of clothes and papers and random junk that's
        just been accumulating in the back of my closet, for over a year. and no matter what i tried to do i
        couldn't
        for whatever reason get rid of that mess. i tried rearranging things, i even added some shelves and
        organizers.
        and yet i could never actually clean it up? something always came up, nothing ever worked, and that big pile
        of random stuff kept accumulating. it wasn't until i started decluttering until i could finally get that
        closet all tidied up. that's when i realized that what i was so hung up on wasn't that i couldn't organize
        what i had, but that maybe i had accumulated too much baggage along my travels, and what i really needed to
        do
        was to learn to let go.</p>

      <h2>Frameworks are a box</h2>
      <p><em>or a framework:</em></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/framework">From Merriam-Webster:</a></p>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                a basic conceptional structure (as of ideas)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  a skeletal, openwork, or structural frame
                </strong>

      <p>recently i've been making stuff without a framework, from scratch. to me, developing without a framework is
        like putting all my stuff out on the floor. conversely when i was using frameworks it felt like i was using
        a
        box, or a bunch of boxes. after assigning your stuff to various boxes, it becomes convenient to throw things
        into boxes. eventually you develop a symbiotic relationship with the boxes, because they act as kind of an
        externalied way of thinking about stuff, a means of forgetting.</p>

      <h2>but sometimes, you just stuff too many things into a box</h2>
      <p>sometimes, the framework becomes a crutch. sometimes you start to think that a framework can do things it's
        not meant for, because sometimes forgetting is more convenient than thinking. and you do this again and
        again

      <h2>Laying things out and being a beginner again</h2>
      <p>has society advanced past raw HTML and CSS? is writing web UIs with the HTML DOM even a good idea? will
        robots
        write HTML in the future, so we can leave the debate on the best state management library for javascript to
        them?
        i don't know but i know that i haven't felt like i had a grasp of the internals of web technologies for quite
        some
        time now, and that scares me a bit. and i think the best way to get a grasp of them is for me to build back
        up.
        frameworks have let myself forget, and that's okay. but for now, i want to remember again.
