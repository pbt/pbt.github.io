      <p>
        I made <strong><a href="https://github.com/pbt/dragula">Dragula</a></strong>, a highly experimental extension to
        macOS that adds weight to one of the oldest
        user interface
        interactions ever: The Finder&rsquo;s
        drag-and-drop interaction.
      </p>

      <p>In the world of Dragula, when you drag a file (or files), you will find
        it easier if the files are smaller in size, and harder if they are larger in size. A small GIF is easy to drag;
        you can likely move one across the screen while barely moving
        your mouse. But you might find it nigh impossible to move a large file, like a movie or the Xcode IDE. </p>

      <p>Indeed, in the
        world of Dragula, <em>every
          drag-and-drop interaction involving files is weighted</em>: individual files, folders, and even Finder
        windows.
      </p>

      <p>You can view the <a href="https://github.com/pbt/dragula">source code</a>, or read on below to see why I did
        this
        and how I did it.</p>

      <h2>The unbearable weightlessness of drag-and-drop</h2>
      <p>Drag-and-drop has been a mainstay of
        personal
        computing since <a href="https://folklore.org/A_Floppy_named_lsadkfjalhkjh.html?sort=date?sort=date">it first
          showed up in the
          first Macintosh</a>.
        It&rsquo;s easy to see why: We drag things around a lot in real life! Direct manipulation is incredibly powerful
        and intuitive. It&rsquo;s so intuitive that there&rsquo;s evidence we <a
          href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2460625.2460650">spend more effort to move digital things that represent
          heavy
          real-life things</a>. Despite our world becoming more virtual, drag-and-drop is arguably the most powerful
        interaction it has ever been.

      <p>And yet, every drag-and-drop interaction is designed to feel the same, no matter what you&rsquo;re dragging.
        That made me curious: I wanted to
        play around with the conventions of drag and drop a little bit and I wanted to see what that would feel like.
        Differentiating
        drag and drop based on file size seemed like a great first step.</p>

      <p>(plus, I thought it would be silly)</p>

      <h2>First sketches</h2>
      <p>From the get-go, my initial idea was to use macOS&rsquo; <a
          href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibility">accessibility APIs.</a>
        In summary, accessiblity APIs are ways for assistive technologies, such as screen readers or adaptive
        controllers,
        to read what&rsquo;s on the screen, know when the user interacts, and
        perform actions on behalf of the user. These APIs are key to implementing accessible alternatives to a mouse,
        keyboard, or display, but they are also used by utilities that augment the macOS user interface. For example,
        Rectangle uses the accessibility API to implement window &ldquo;snapping&rdquo; by reading your mouse position
        while dragging a window, and then to resize the window itself.</p>

      <p>My initial idea followed from my experiences using Rectangle. When the user starts dragging a file, I would
        draw a fake proxy file on top of the icon. Then I could control the dragging interaction any way I wanted, since
        I would basically &ldquo;steal&rdquo; whatever was on Finder. (In retrospect, this seems a lot like the type of
        solution a React engineer would immediately reach for, doesn&rsquo;t it?)

      <p>As I was bouncing this idea around the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> for a few weeks, we
        converged on a
        much
        simpler idea: Read the file size of whatever I was dragging, and then change the pointer speed as some factor of
        the file
        size. Not only was this much simpler, I knew it was workable because I knew of software that did this!
        Logi Options+ is an example of software that allow you to configure pointer speed
        via their UI and even remap the behavior of buttons. Once I could fit the pieces into my head, I felt motivated
        to
        implement it. My new game plan was as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Intercept mouse events for file drag and drop
        <li>Use the Accessibility APIs to read the selection
        <li>Change the mouse sensitivity based on your selection
      </ol>

    </section>
    <section>

      <h2>Starting with dessert: Implementing mouse sensitivity changing</h2>
      <p>I woke up bright and early (10am, I think) on a Monday, ready to get started. Because I was supposed to learn
        Rust,
        I only wanted to spend a week on this, so I set a goal to have a workable prototype that I could demo on the
        Thursday of
        the same week. For those of you counting, that&rsquo;s four days.

      <p>There was one hitch: I didn&rsquo;t really know how to use Swift, the preferred language for interfacing with
        the foundational APIs of macOS, including the Accessibility API and the input device API I wanted to use. Web
        searches on Google seemed pretty dire, surfacing
        only the official API documentation, which was very inaccessible, especially for an accessibility library.

      <p>So I changed my search strategy: I looked up &ldquo;macos open source mouse drivers&rdquo; and hoped that I
        would
        find
        something.
        And then I found LinearMouse, a really great mouse driver utility. Best of all, they had wrapped the input
        device
        code inside an easy-to-use library that was also easy to move to my project. And it worked for every pointing
        device,
        not just one manufacturer&rsquo;s product. Beautiful!

      <p>I found it really useful to start small. Once I had a sample app running with the pointer library, then I just
        tried changing it programmatically inside the code itself. Then I added the first bits of drag and drop, using
        code from Rectangle as reference. I also found it strangely useful to tackle things peripheral to the core
        functionality, such as the prompts to ask the user to enable accessibility permissions. But a day and a half in,
        and I still had not figured out how to actually read the Finder selection.

    <section>

      <h2>Go off, (Apple)Script</h2>
      <p>AppleScript is an automation scripting language for macOS. It has been part of the platform for a while, so
        it&rsquo;s
        rather capable. For example, you can do this to get the Finder selection:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-applescript">tell application "Finder" to get the selection</code></pre>

      This returns a list of files that looks like this:

      <pre><code class="language-applescript">
          {application file "Xcode.app" of folder "Applications" of startup disk
          of application "Finder", application file "Visual Studio Code.app" of folder "Applications"
          of startup disk of application "Finder"}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p> You know, there was a world where everything looked like AppleScript. I think that world would have been
        kind of cool. But I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with this. I was used to standard POSIX paths and C-style
        imperative
        programming, and so was everyone else. And documentation was very scant.

      <p> I decided to use AppleScript to get the selection size directly. For those frantically searching, human or
        computer, here&rsquo;s the code to do that that will return the selection size in bytes, including zero
        if there is no selection:</p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-applescript">
          set theSize to 0

          tell application "Finder"
          set theSelection to the selection as alias list
          repeat with theItem in theSelection
          set theInfo to (info for theItem)
          set theSize to theSize + (size of theInfo)
          end repeat
          end tell
          return theSize
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p><em>Spoiler alert:</em> This is, however, not the code I actually ended up using. More on that later.</p>

      <p> To call AppleScript within my code, I wanted to use <code>NSAppleScript</code> but
        couldn&rsquo;t
        figure out how to make that work. Instead, I shell out to <code>osascript</code> and read the output from the
        command
        line. <em>yeah.</em>

      <h2>Getting ahead of myself</h2>
      <p> The code that intercepts pointer actions is called an <code>EventTap</code>. It is essentially a global event
        handler. Those interested should mosey on over to the source code, because the full details are a little
        hairy for a blog post, but basically I could take my script code above, read the result, and then normalize it
        into
        a pointer resolution. Here&rsquo;s the code that normalizes, by the way:
      <pre>
        <code class="language-swift">
          extension Double {
          func toNormalizedResolutionValue() -> Double {
          let slope = (1995.0/1242850962)
          return self * slope + 75
          }
          }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>It&rsquo;s probably bad practice to attach this functionality to <code>Double</code> itself, but I thought
        that was fun.

      <p>But, I was running into a curious issue: The AppleScript took the value of the <em>last</em> selection I had,
        not
        the current one! So if I selected <code>Xcode.app</code> and then selected <code>Visual Studio Code.app</code>,
        it was taking the size of <code>Xcode.app</code> when I was dragging <code>Visual Studio Code.app.</code>

      <p>Remember when I told you that the <code>EventTap</code> <em>intercepts</em> pointer actions? As it turns out,
        my
        event handler
        ran <em>before</em> the event had propagated to Finder and so it was reading the selection before the selection
        updated.

      <p>I solved this by getting the selection contents directly using the accessibility APIs (by checking for the
        presence of the <code>url</code> attribute on the element):

      <pre><code class="language-swift">
          if !isMultiSelecting && element.getValue(.filename) is NSString,
          let url = element.getValue(.url) as? URL {
          // ...
          }
        </code></pre>

      <p>(shoutout to Swift's if-statements separated by commas and if-let syntax! i think Swift is such a neat
        language!)

      <p>But then I was finding it still
        too slow, especially
        for directories, and
        macOS does not like it when your event taps take too slow, since they block I/O. So I learned I had
        to defer some operations to a
        background thread using
        <code>DispatchQueue.global</code>, and while not particularly thread-safe, this wasn&rsquo;t really a concern of
        this
        code.
    </section>
    <section>

      <h2>Multi-select</h2>
      <p>At this point, I was ready to demo Dragula to the Recurse Center. I got a lot of enthusiastic feedback and
        was ready to work on all of the features that would really put a bow on top of what I got. Unfortunately,
        at this point, I had really ripped my hair out learning all the vagaries of macOS programming: the inconsistent
        documentation and Xcode itself. I was ready to drag Xcode straight to the trash.
        <br>
        <img width="256" height="256"
          style="border-radius: var(--gap); border: 1px solid var(--highlight); margin: 0 auto;"
          alt="trying to delete Xcode with Dragula enabled; but I can't drag it far because Xcode is really big."
          src="img/xcode.gif">
        <br>
      <p>... Oh, right. Well, perhaps throwing things away is a drastic action. Instead I slept on it for a week, and
        after doing other stuff I dove back into it and implemented multi-select.

      <p>Remember when I said I ended up doing things differently? I found that in order to handle multiple selection it
        was important for me to synchronize the selection from Finder instead of reading it directly each time. That way
        I could compare selections to see if they had changed (when you drag, you always drag on a file handle, no
        matter
        how large the selction, so I had to keep track of whether or not I was dragging just one file or multiple.) Here
        is the code to retrieve all the paths in the selection, in POSIX format, separated by colons:

      <pre><code class="language-applescript">
          set thePaths to ""

          tell application "Finder"
          set theSelection to the selection as alias list
          repeat with theItem in theSelection
          set thePaths to thePaths & POSIX path of theItem & ":"
          end repeat
          return thePaths
          end tell
        </code></pre>

      After this followed, I made a cute lil icon, inspired by the
      namesake <a href="http://www.munsterkoach.com/franklin2.htm"><em>Drag-U-La</em></a>, added a UI (in SwiftUI!)
      to configure Dragula&rsquo;s behavior, and put it onto GitHub.
    </section>
    <section>

      <h2>Conclusion: Don&rsquo;t be a drag, just be a queen</h2>
      <p> I had a lot of fun working on this project. It&rsquo;s been the highlight of the Recurse Center for me so far.
        I didn&rsquo;t know any Swift, a lot of the people I paired with didn&rsquo;t know any Swift, and I was able to
        get this up and running in less than a week. It was the most <a
          href="https://ntietz.com/blog/write-more-useless-software/">useless</a>
        software I ever wrote.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I have Dragula enabled, and drag a small text file, and it flies across the screen. And I
        haven&rsquo;t
        stopped smiling
        at that.</p>
      <p>How is it like to use Dragula? <a href="https://github.com/pbt/dragula">Install it yourself and find out.</a>
        Maybe install it on a friend&rsquo;s computer to prank them. But my hope is that at least one soul pokes around
        and learns how they can use the APIs I used to control computers in new, unexpected, fun ways.
