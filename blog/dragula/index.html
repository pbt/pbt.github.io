    <p>
      I made <strong><a href="https://github.com/pbt/dragula">Dragula</a></strong>, a highly experimental extension to
      macOS that adds weight to one of the oldest
      user interface
      interactions ever: The Finder&rsquo;s
      drag-and-drop interaction.
    </p>

    <p>In the world of Dragula, when you drag a file (or files), you will find
      it easier if the files are smaller in size, and harder if they are larger in size. A small GIF is easy to drag;
      you can likely move one across the screen while barely moving
      your mouse. But you might find it nigh impossible to move a large file, like a movie or the Xcode IDE. </p>

    <p>Indeed, in the
      world of Dragula, <em>every
        drag-and-drop interaction involving files is weighted</em>: individual files, folders, and even Finder windows.
    </p>

    <p>You can view the <a href="https://github.com/pbt/dragula">source code</a>, or read on below to see why I did this
      and how I did it.</p>

    <h2>The unbearable weightlessness of drag-and-drop</h2>
    <p>Drag-and-drop has been a mainstay of
      personal
      computing since <a href="https://folklore.org/A_Floppy_named_lsadkfjalhkjh.html?sort=date?sort=date">it first
        showed up in the
        first Macintosh</a>.
      It&rsquo;s easy to see why: We drag things around a lot in real life! Direct manipulation is incredibly powerful
      and intuitive. It&rsquo;s so intuitive that there&rsquo;s evidence we <a
        href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2460625.2460650">spend more effort to move digital things that represent
        heavy
        real-life things</a>. Despite our world becoming more virtual, drag-and-drop is arguably the most powerful
      interaction it has ever been.

    <p>And yet, every drag-and-drop interaction is designed to feel the same, no matter what you&rsquo;re dragging.
      That made me curious: I wanted to
      play around with the conventions of drag and drop a little bit and I wanted to see what that would feel like.
      Differentiating
      drag and drop based on file size seemed like a great first step.</p>

    <p>(plus, I thought it would be silly)</p>

    <p style="display: block; text-align: center; width: 100%;">&ldquo;But
      Xcode&rsquo;s heavier
      than emojis!&rdquo; <small><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fC2oke5MFg">With apologies to
          Limmy.</a></small>
    </p>
    <h2>First sketches</h2>
    <p>From the get-go, my initial idea was to use macOS&rsquo; <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibility">accessibility APIs.</a>
      In summary, accessiblity APIs are ways for assistive technologies, such as screen readers or adaptive controllers,
      to read what&rsquo;s on the screen, know when the user interacts, and
      perform actions on behalf of the user. These APIs are key to implementing accessible alternatives to a mouse,
      keyboard, or display, but they are also used by utilities that augment the macOS user interface. For example,
      Rectangle uses the accessibility API to implement window &ldquo;snapping&rdquo; by reading your mouse position
      while dragging a window, and then to resize the window itself.</p>

    <p>My initial idea followed from my experiences using Rectangle. When the user starts dragging a file, I would
      draw a fake proxy file on top of the icon. Then I could control the dragging interaction any way I wanted, since
      I would basically &ldquo;steal&rdquo; whatever was on Finder. (In retrospect, this seems a lot like the type of
      solution a React engineer would immediately reach for, doesn&rsquo;t it?)

    <p>As I was bouncing this idea around the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> for a few weeks, we
      converged on a
      much
      simpler idea: Read the file size of whatever I was dragging, and then change the pointer speed as some factor of
      the file
      size. Not only was this much simpler, I knew it was workable because I knew of software that did this!
      Logi Options+ is an example of software that allow you to configure pointer speed
      via their UI and even remap the behavior of buttons. Once I could fit the pieces into my head, I felt motivated to
      implement it. My new game plan was as follows:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Intercept mouse events for file drag and drop
      <li>Use the Accessibility APIs to read the selection
      <li>Change the mouse sensitivity based on your selection
    </ol>

    <h2>Starting with dessert: Implementing mouse sensitivity changing</h2>
    <p>I woke up bright and early (10am, I think) on a Monday, ready to get started. Because I was supposed to learn
      Rust,
      I only wanted to spend a week on this, so I set a goal to have a workable prototype that I could demo on the
      Thursday of
      the same week. For those of you counting, that&rsquo;s four days.

    <p>There was one hitch: I didn&rsquo;t really know how to use Swift, the preferred language for interfacing with
      the foundational APIs of macOS, including the Accessibility API and the input device API I wanted to use. Web
      searches on Google seemed pretty dire, surfacing
      only the official API documentation, which was very inaccessible, especially for an accessibility library.

    <p>So I changed my search strategy: I looked up &ldquo;macos open source mouse drivers&rdquo; and hoped that I would
      find
      something.
      And then I found LinearMouse, a really great mouse driver utility. Best of all, they had wrapped the input device
      code inside an easy-to-use library that was also easy to move to my project. And it worked for every pointing
      device,
      not just one manufacturer&rsquo;s product. Beautiful!

    <p>I found it really useful to start small. Once I had a sample app running with the pointer library, then I just
      tried changing it programmatically inside the code itself. Then I added the first bits of drag and drop, using
      code from Rectangle as reference. I also found it strangely useful to tackle things peripheral to the core
      functionality, such as the prompts to ask the user to enable accessibility permissions. But a day and a half in,
      and I still had not figured out how to actually read the Finder selection.

    <h2>Go off, (Apple)Script</h2>
    <p>AppleScript is an automation scripting language for macOS. It has been part of the platform for a while, so
      it&rsquo;s
      rather capable. For example, you can do this to get the Finder selection:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-applescript">tell application "Finder" to get the selection</code></pre>

    This returns a list of files that looks like this:

    <pre><code class="language-applescript">
        {application file "Xcode.app" of folder "Applications" of startup disk
        of application "Finder", application file "Visual Studio Code.app" of folder "Applications"
        of startup disk of application "Finder"}
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p> You know, there was a world where everything looked like AppleScript. I think that world would have been
      kind of cool. But I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with this. I was used to standard POSIX paths and C-style
      imperative
      programming, and so was everyone else. And documentation was very scant.

    <p> I decided to use AppleScript to get the selection size directly. For those frantically searching, human or
      computer, here&rsquo;s the code to do that that will return the selection size in bytes, including zero
      if there is no selection:</p>

    <pre>
      <code class="language-applescript">
        set theSize to 0

        tell application "Finder"
        set theSelection to the selection as alias list
        repeat with theItem in theSelection
        set theInfo to (info for theItem)
        set theSize to theSize + (size of theInfo)
        end repeat
        end tell
        return theSize
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p><em>Spoiler alert:</em> This is, however, not the code I actually ended up using. More on that later.</p>

    <p> To call AppleScript within my code, I wanted to use <code>NSAppleScript</code> but
      couldn&rsquo;t
      figure out how to make that work. Instead, I shell out to <code>osascript</code> and read the output from the
      command
      line. <em>yeah.</em>

    <h2>Getting ahead of myself</h2>
    <p> The code that intercepts pointer actions is called an <code>EventTap</code>. It is essentially a global event
      handler. Those interested should mosey on over to the source code, because the full details are a little
      hairy for a blog post, but basically I could take my script code above, read the result, and then normalize it
      into
      a pointer resolution. Here&rsquo;s the code that normalizes, by the way:
    <pre>
      <code class="language-swift">
        extension Double {
        func toNormalizedResolutionValue() -> Double {
        let slope = (1995.0/1242850962)
        return self * slope + 75
        }
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>It&rsquo;s probably bad practice to attach this functionality to <code>Double</code> itself, but I thought
      that was fun.

    <p>But, I was running into a curious issue: The AppleScript took the value of the <em>last</em> selection I had, not
      the current one! So if I selected <code>Xcode.app</code> and then selected <code>Visual Studio Code.app</code>,
      it was taking the size of <code>Xcode.app</code> when I was dragging <code>Visual Studio Code.app.</code>

    <p>Remember when I told you that the <code>EventTap</code> <em>intercepts</em> pointer actions? As it turns out, my
      event handler
      ran <em>before</em> the event had propagated to Finder and so it was reading the selection before the selection
      updated.

    <p>I solved this by getting the selection contents directly using the accessibility APIs (by checking for the
      presence of the <code>url</code> attribute on the element):

    <pre><code class="language-swift">
        if !isMultiSelecting && element.getValue(.filename) is NSString,
        let url = element.getValue(.url) as? URL {
        // ...
        }
      </code></pre>

    <p>(shoutout to Swift's if-statements separated by commas and if-let syntax! i think Swift is such a neat language!)

    <p>But then I was finding it still
      too slow, especially
      for directories, and
      macOS does not like it when your event taps take too slow, since they block I/O. So I learned I had
      to defer some operations to a
      background thread using
      <code>DispatchQueue.global</code>, and while not particularly thread-safe, this wasn&rsquo;t really a concern of
      this
      code.

    <h2>Multi-select</h2>
    <p>At this point, I was ready to demo Dragula to the Recurse Center. I got a lot of enthusiastic feedback and
      was ready to work on all of the features that would really put a bow on top of what I got. Unfortunately,
      at this point, I had really ripped my hair out learning all the vagaries of macOS programming: the inconsistent
      documentation and Xcode itself. I was ready to drag Xcode straight to the trash.
      <br>
      <img width="256" height="256"
        style="border-radius: var(--gap); border: 1px solid var(--highlight); margin: 0 auto;"
        alt="me trying to delete Xcode with Dragula enabled" src="img/xcode.gif">
      <br>
    <p>... Oh, right. Well, perhaps throwing things away is a drastic action. Instead I slept on it for a week, and
      after doing other stuff I dove back into it and implemented multi-select.

    <p>Remember when I said I ended up doing things differently? I found that in order to handle multiple selection it
      was important for me to synchronize the selection from Finder instead of reading it directly each time. That way
      I could compare selections to see if they had changed (when you drag, you always drag on a file handle, no matter
      how large the selction, so I had to keep track of whether or not I was dragging just one file or multiple.) Here
      is the code to retrieve all the paths in the selection, in POSIX format, separated by colons:

    <pre><code class="language-applescript">
        set thePaths to ""

        tell application "Finder"
        set theSelection to the selection as alias list
        repeat with theItem in theSelection
        set thePaths to thePaths & POSIX path of theItem & ":"
        end repeat
        return thePaths
        end tell
      </code></pre>

    After this followed, I made a cute lil icon, inspired by the
    namesake <a href="http://www.munsterkoach.com/franklin2.htm"><em>Drag-U-La</em></a>, added a UI (in SwiftUI!)
    to configure Dragula&rsquo;s behavior, and put it onto GitHub.

    <h2>Conclusion: Don&rsquo;t be a drag, just be a queen</h2>
    <p> I had a lot of fun working on this project. It&rsquo;s been the highlight of the Recurse Center for me so far.
      I didn&rsquo;t know any Swift, a lot of the people I paired with didn&rsquo;t know any Swift, and I was able to
      get this up and running in less than a week. It was the most <a
        href="https://ntietz.com/blog/write-more-useless-software/">useless</a>
      software I ever wrote.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I have Dragula enabled, and drag a small text file, and it flies across the screen. And I haven&rsquo;t
      stopped smiling
      at that.</p>
    <p>How is it like to use Dragula? <a href="https://github.com/pbt/dragula">Install it yourself and find out.</a>
      Maybe install it on a friend&rsquo;s computer to prank them. But my hope is that at least one soul pokes around
      and learns how they can use the APIs I used to control computers in new, unexpected, fun ways.
