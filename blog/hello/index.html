      <p>Hi! If you're reading this, I'm in the process of building out this website. It's a little bit of
        an experiment for me (to be okay with sharing my work in an incomplete form) and it's also a wonderful
        way to announce to the world that I'm currently at the <a href="https://recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>,
        from
        now
        till late March.</p>
      <h2>Back to basics</h2>
      <p>I've treated personal websites as kind of a way to set an "era" for me. My last website was a sleek
        portfolio I built with Next.js. It was very clean and professsional.</p>
      <p> Except I never updated it! So, for this era, I decided to start writing my blog using the tools I've
        always known (since I was eleven): Writing HTML and CSS in an editor. There's no preprocessing, and this
        time
        not even a build system or a CI: I'm dragging and dropping files into Neocities like I used to in 2008.</p>
      <p>This isn't really some sort of statement against build systems or anything, but rather a reset,
        a way to get myself back in the beginner's mindset. What is the actual "best" way for me to build software?
        How can I make myself most productive, in a way that works for me, not just what I "should" be doing?</p>
      <h2>Doing it live</h2>
      <p>
        I want to be okay with sharing my work in an incomplete form. It's a way for me to ward off that
        sense of perfectionism, which for me comes from a place of insecurity. I probably won't be "doing it live"
        once I get
        this blog really up and running (editing my writing is generally a good thing I think), but it's so nice to
        give myself permission to get that feedback loop up and going. Quick
        feedback loops are a big reason of why I went into programming! </p>
